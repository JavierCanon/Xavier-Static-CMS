### File Content

Interesting books, dissertations, academic papers, maps, meeting notes, articles, memos, reports, etc. are available on a wide variety of subjects - but over years, decades, of time resources can easily 'disappear' from the internet... Websites are no longer available, agencies delete documents they are no longer legally required to retain, older versions of a document are not kept when a newer version comes out, departments shut down, funding runs out...

File Content is intended to allow the creation of a 'library' of Files that you can tag, search, share and retain. The File you choose for File Content will be copied to the site just like an image or photo would be.

Notes:
 - No File Previews are automatically generated - you will need to add any images/previews/etc. manually to the Body Content
 - To help when working with PDFs the program can extract pages of a PDF as Image Content for quick/easy use in the Body Content - details:
   - To use this functionality pdftocairo must be available on your computer and the location of pdftocairo must be set in the Settings
   - On windows the easiest way to install pdftocairo is to install MiKTeX - [Getting MiKTeX - MiKTeX.org](https://miktex.org/download)
   - The page you specify to generate an image is the page that the PDF Viewer you are using is showing (rather than the 'content page number' printed at the bottom of a page) - for example with a book in PDF format to get an image of the 'cover' the page number is '1'
 - The File Content page can contain a link to download the file - but it is not appropriate to offer all content for download, use the 'Show Public Download Link' to turn on/off the download link. This setting will impact the behaviour of the 'filedownloadlink' bracket code - if 'Show Public Download Link' is unchecked a filedownloadlink bracket code will become a link to the File Content Page (rather than a download link for the content).
 - Regardless of the 'Show Public Download Link' the file will be copied to the site - if you have a sensitive document that should not be copied beyond your computer consider just creating Post Content for it - the File Content type is only useful for content where you want the File to be 'with' the site.
 - If appropriate consider including links to the original source in the Body Content
